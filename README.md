# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in finance

# The project: 
This project was part of the AI Core data analytics course, it involved conducting exploratory data analysis on a large set of financial loans data.
This involved cleaning the data, imputing null values where required, transforming skewed data and then drawing conclusions about the state of the loans.
I found this a challenging project, requiring me to piece together knowledge of object orientated programming, python, pandas and data visualisation software
Particularly skills I learnt where:
- changing data types
- imputing null values appropriately
- assessing skew of data and transforming data
- filtering data for specific subsets

# File structure of the project
db_utils.py - initialises a class to connect to a remote RBS database where the loan data is stored and saves this to a csv file
data.csv - the original data as a csv file before cleaning and analysis 
data_post_EDA.csv - the data following cleaning
mainworkbook.ipynb - interactive notebook explaining how data was cleaned
analysis.ipynb - interactive notebook explaining how data was analysed and conclusions drawn
EDAClasses.py - used to create classes to carry out cleaning of data, this was ultimately not used due to deadlines and issues in initialising the classes in the ipynb

# Areas for improvement
In the future I would like to better utilise classes to carry out data cleaning, so that they can be used again for any future work
